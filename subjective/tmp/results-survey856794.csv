What suggestions/wishes do you have for Debian LTS?
===================================================

➣ None.

➣ remove systemd from everywhere

➣ Keep doing! You are doing great work!

➣ Continue like that, the effort is very appreciated!

➣ Keep up the good work.

➣ stay healthy!

➣ no

➣ 1. LTS Debian versions should jump a release (e.g. if Jessie is LTS, Stretch should not and Buster should be again, and so on...)
2. Bring Debian LTS time to 10 years as for RHEL

➣ Faster.

➣ Faster updates

➣ I hope this will become the standard.

➣ Keep up the good work!

➣ No

➣ see above. 

➣ My expected use for LTS is the fear of 32 bit versions going away.
I use both 64 & 32 and support others who rely on 32 bit Debian.
If 32 bit Debian goes away, I'll be hoping for 32 bit LTS to continue using 32 bit for a long as possible.

➣ As a software developer myself, I know how much work it is to support older software so I can only thank the team for their effort.
Wish: Easy and consistent way to upgrade one Debian LTS to the next Debian release or LTS? :)

➣ A safer VPN toolchain.

➣ documentation could be a lot better

➣ Perhaps it could advertise it's existence more loudly? I didn't know it was a thing.

➣ nothing i am fine with the current state

➣ Update Firefox at least once a year.

➣ Updates more quickly

➣ LTS is great thing to have is resources allow it.

➣ Even longer support to foster my laziness.

➣ nothing

➣ already great

➣ Perhaps a better explanation of what ELTS is or a clear and definitive date of the EOL of each Debian LTS enabled release.

➣ Better visibility what packages/architectures are supported and which might end up without support before this is getting relevant (so you're forced to take care through an unplanned dist-upgrade). 
Better on-boarding process for non-Freexian contributors.
Communicate EOL way more upfront than just a few days before the actual EOL date.
More frequent updates of debian-security-support packages towards stable but also to oldstable and any further relevant/supported release, e.g. the pdns-recursor EOL seems to be still invisible.

➣ Keep the good work up!

➣ Thanks for the work. Maybe have more direct info for the user when packages are no longer covered if he invokes apt. I do not know if everybody knows debian-security-support.

➣ I think, organizations should think about an upgrade path, and that it’d be great, if Debian LTS wouldn’t be needed.

➣ Go for 10 years of security patches

➣ more updates

➣ Have more up to date drivers and kernels in the LTS version

➣ That some bigger updates get backported or even reach LTS of the package is otherwise next to useless.

➣ I wish to have a stable and secure system with minimum maintenance overhead.

➣ new versions of php and mariadb updated more frequently, I would love to see php 8 on Debian Stable, and the Deepin and Lomiri environments with their non-free Debian isos.

➣ NO systemd dependence, NO Python dependence for mission-critical components, EVER.

➣ keep on doing a great job!

➣ Continue offering it. Many people need/want the stability and long term support Debian LTS offers.

➣ Free Selektion of systemd or another init procedure

➣ Little Faster updates.

➣ Even longer LTS support.

➣ Maybe some sort of automated backports mechanism (opt-in, not enabled by default), which could be added to apt sources & pinned instead of testing/unstable directly?  Packages in it would be newer, but linked against LTS libraries. Anything that fails to build could be omitted; this would just be there to solve the simple cases. 

➣ Update popular programs sush as web browsers etc.

➣ N/A

➣ Need regularly up to date latest package of apps like LOffice, Gimp, Firefox, Inkscape, Scribus etc. 

➣ I would love it if LTS was one year longer, so that I can directly switch to the release+3 instead of release+2.

➣ Somewhat better notifications in the update process. I had actually forgotten about when the LTS ended for  Jessie and was only made aware of it thanks to a Reddit post. Had there been some sort of notice (preferably in a different color) when running apt update/upgrade in advance I wouldn’t have had to upgrade quite as quickly.

➣ Perhaps offer easier means of monetary contributions. And transparency about such contributions. Cryptocurrencies, Patreon or similar platforms, donations via cash or check, and how such donations will directly benefit Debian. Also, clearer communication regarding commercial support services. If Slackware can pull in thousands of extra dollars a month in donations, why not Debian? 

➣ Have a better Package version like Arch but i know is hard

➣ More funding for Debian LTS

➣ Keep going and thank you. It's been a great distro for most of the time.

➣ More contributors.

➣ Handover + Communication + Period of LTS are fine and good and professional. 

➣ Personally I would like to see *more* communication from the LTS contributors to me as the maintainer of at least on package that regularly gets a security update. I'd like to help and avoid duplicate effort. Often the effort can easily apply to stable and oldstable as well. Having a nice set of git commits is nicer than to $(gbp import-dsc).

➣ Raise the bar on documentation standards and limit official sources so access to the information doesn't require advanced search skills. 

➣ If I were to wish for anything it would be for slightly more control over the software that gets installed through the installer. I understand that the software included
in the different desktop environments isn't a responsibility for the Debian developers, but if I had the option to not install Libre Office when I do my usual Debian stable + XFCE install, I would be very happy and both me and your servers could avoid a good bit of downloading.

➣ Keep rocking!

➣ Difficult to suggest but PHP 5.6 for Jessie was corrected for security problems after it's upstream EOL. It will be great if more packages (Xen for exemple) can be supported as long. But I know it's a very difficult work.

➣ I wish it wasn’t so expensive or complex to use ELTS or I’d use it. I understand though that ultimately it takes effort and so it should cost money. But it’s too much money, even for my business, and so when LTS ends, I’m in the same position I tried to avoid (having to upgrade).

➣ Potentially to prioritize specific features that users can make use of. 

➣ No

➣ For packages, to get the latest stable releases that are available in the newest Debian releases.

➣ See answer for #12

➣ Keep it up.

➣ 3 yeas and 5 for ELTS.

➣ I'd like it to remain reliable & maintainable, and to provide options wherever possible (init system, desktop environment, web browser, etc.).

➣ Make LTS support even longer! Of course that is just a wish. I realize you already have your hands full.

➣ Support as many packages as possible in the official Debian repositories for LTS support.

➣ Keep going.

➣ Keep up the good work

➣ Keep going! Your work is important!
Is it feasible to have some kind of user-tagging protocol for packages that have bugs in LTS versions?
This might be useful for 'how-can-i-help' and other tools to highlight areas where contributions could be made.

➣ Mailing list for CVEs fixed

➣ Keep the good job.

➣ Use Latest packages which are not in core of the os.

➣ For any Debian distribution: give back the choice and give back KISS.
I'm not a professional sysadmin, I'm a coder who has extended it's knowledge to basic system administration for personal purposes (FW, mail, web server ...) and for professional purposes (when coding something that needs a server, what best than bringing up one yourself ?). I'm not following all the news related to changes every day, so I did not see systemd coming.
On my personal FW, when upgrading to the first Debian using it, it was a disaster: there was a new init system I knew nothing about, it was forbidding my system to boot, and I had zero clue where to begin to solve the problem. So, I did not solve it, I had to reinstall from scratch. Not happy.
Since then, systemd appears to be a cancer of some sort (Steve B., get out this body!): it grabs parts of the system, make them harder to understand and configure.
One of the most frustrating problem I had recently (end of 2019 / beginning of 2020) was network configuration: I did a Debian Stable fresh install on a system dedicated to spy the network (samples and products testing, do they phone home and things like that). Obviously, I needed complete control over the network configuration. So I made modifications to set a fixed IP address on both side. Problem: on one interface, I ended up with two IP addresses: the fixed one I set, and another one obtained by DHCP. What? I have no notes, no forensic, nothing to prove what I say because:
- it should have been straightforward. It became panic and irrational try this, try that, it makes no sense but what does?. I used both vim /etc/network/interfaces and the graphical network configuration tools for sure. But why would I need a graphical desktop in the first place for this kind of purpose? Trying to imitate Windows?...
- I chose to install a Devuan instead. Sad, isn't it?
Of course, this is far from the central point of this questionnaire. And of course, I should not forget all the things that are working well, and more over, all the people behind them, and thanks a lot for that. But I sense that one of the oldest and beloved Linux distribution is loosing its fan base (fan in many acceptation, pro and amateurs, etc.). I, myself, am looking for a replacement without systemd, and am already trying Devuan, and thinking to give again a try to Gentoo.

➣ N/a

➣ Keep your great work going!

➣ Ancient and stable are not always the same thing.

➣ The time of LTS may be longer for special security updates.

➣ support more software ideally full repo

➣ N/A

➣ Nothing

➣ ability to easy install latest software.

➣ If there was a loss of a LTS then it would encourage us to move away from Debian, which is not what we want. It would be good to make the LTS effort more official and supported

➣ NA

➣ prolong support of LTS

➣ Do not use surveys which session expires while the responder writes his answers.

➣ In our situation, having even longer support (10+ years) for security updates would be great. But I understand it is not an easy thing to do. I hope to see more work with the Linux Foundation Civil Infrastructure Project to make this happen.

➣ I wish LTS people took over regular stable updates too - they issue updates faster and more frequently for our use case (LAMP)

➣ nothing, sorry

➣ Easily install packages from current stable or testing branch if necessary

➣ Thank you very much for LTS.

➣ It would be good if the updates made during the LTS phase were included in the distribution at archive.debian.org at the end of the LTS cycle.

➣ Would be nice to make eLTS an official Debian project in Debian infrastructure.

➣ Rolling updates

➣ Nothing

➣ None

➣ Make updated software available in the repos faster

➣ I hope that enough people can be paid to work on LTS! :)

➣ None. 

➣ n/a

➣ The(majority of the world just don't deserves it...

➣ Add stuff to move from LTS to ELTS magically please.

➣ N.A.

➣ I'm no expert, but if I were to think of suggestions/ideas: Consider joining forces with Ubuntu LTS maintainers. Make sure to include platform-type packages like tomcat, python among supported packages.

➣ Provide a suggested annual donation amount for commercial businesses using LTS! :)

➣ Backport new LTS kernels. Backport new Gnome versions.

➣ Provide updated chromium.

➣ Keep it up!

➣ Make more visible what packages are supported in Debian LTS, as sometime, I saw users feels confident that the Debian LTS covers all their packages, but in fact it's not.

➣ I would like that LTS project become a debian project and not an external project not maintained by volunteers but maintained from the original package developer 

➣ To be for more years, even safer and with a few more package updates in newer versions.

➣ Hummm, may I suggest to add 5 more years of LTS support?

➣ None, I just really, really appreciate the volunteers and the support.

➣ Thanks a lot, keep up the good work!

➣ To do it longer and with more coverage, ideally based on which software is actually still used within LTS.
If you do such a survey in future again, you should definitely ask more details about what exactly people still use and why, so that you can focus more on updates that are very relevant for many.

➣ Keep it up :)

➣ Please continue to deliver 32 bits distro for some years.
And I would like to say that XFCE is my favorite desktop.

➣ Don't be too strict / harsh on the end user opinions. Most of the end users might be sysadmins or just regular users, but are not developers. Linux community in general is very rude to newcomers, and that has to change. 

➣ Debian LTS works great as is.

➣ TY for maintaining ~5 years of support for the OS.
This permits attention on more important application layer items.

➣ The longer LTS support the better.

➣ stop LTS, requires admins to maintain even more local rerepros with local fixes/backports

➣ * keep backports repository after standard eol
* even longer support

➣ Please extend the LTS philosophy to backports.

➣ no

➣ best wishes for debian LTS

➣ Congratulations and keep it up. You make Linux a professional work tool and not just a broken toy. Thanks for everything

➣ I wish LTS was available for much longer than 3 years. I would recommend using CentOS instead just because it is supported for 10 years.

➣ Write more about how can we help and spread the word a lot more...

➣ Getting out of the dilemma mentioned in question 12 is not that simple; simply appealing to the involved persons to work together etc. won't help, as it's structural.
Of course the cleanest solution would be to separate LTS from Debian (infrastructure) like it's done for ELTS, and treat it as an endorsed and valued derivative.
Besides that Roberto's idea from some mailing list/some pad (let the LTS work in core team be done by LTS people) might help.
Or getting an agreement where LTS invests more, gives more back to Debian proper (in terms of money and/or personpower for infrastructure tasks, like fixing DAK bugs; kind of like LTS renting infrastructure, earmarking x% of (LTS money ≈) LTS time in the pool for Debian infrastructure maintenance/improvements) …

➣ None.

➣ hope it could have more impact on linux

➣ Adding backports.
Other than that, completely content; the problem is rather that bugs are fixed in LTS or even ELTS that are unfixed in stable *and* unstable for *months*. LTS contributors might consider NMUing there in those cases, but I understand that would more than double the effort.

➣ Further distance non-free software from Debian

➣ Longer support :)

➣ longer support date 

➣ I prefer the way Ubuntu handles LTS. It's a bit more clean (IMHO) when it comes to upgrading. It's easy to switch from one LTS to another. 

➣ I wish that the Flatpak backports package gets the same care and update frequency for the whole LTS period. It might be like that already but I couldn't find info about it.

➣ Nothing. If something is working Ok, don't touch it. It works. No more.

➣ keep going

➣ N/A

➣ Automatic upgrade scripts to next LTS

➣ Some software should remain installable for ever

➣ I am very happy that Lts/Elts exist. Please don't stop to work at this. And many thanks for your hard work!

➣ Keep up the great job! 😃

➣ Keep doing this fantastic work.

➣ keep it. dont cancel the lts project.

➣ I would say the option to have stable upgrades for packages.

➣ All cool

➣ please continue the good work

➣ None; it's fine as it is.

➣ I wish Debian would be more like Ubuntu in handling LTS 

➣ More hardware firmaware.

➣ Get lollypop package into the repositories.

➣ Have a compromize between stability of the system, and more current software. 
Driver support from the installation.. e.g. Graphics cards like NVIDIA.

➣ Services for beginners, such as helpfull setup scripts

➣ Don't stray from your path.

➣ Keep this strategy and this feature. very useful and needed. 

➣ My keyboard logitech G15 not working on debian 10.please fix.

➣ I am glad LTS exists. I have been using it with Wheezy to keep Crunchbang Waldorf going for longer and am glad to have the option of taking more time to upgrade in future if I don't want or upgrading is not feasible, due to time constraints, old hardware etc. May spin a server on DigitalOcean in the future and would be happy to keep for five years without a need to upgrade.

➣ Longer would be nice, but that's always the case. I prefer to never have to migrate software on my VPS if possible.

➣ Keep up the good work! I enjoy debian, and being able to use it in longer term projects, or worry less amount migration plans has been awesome.

➣ Keep on

➣ Support more architectures.  RISC-V in particular; for IoT gadgets.

➣ Good to have visibility of new lts releases a year or 2 ahead so I can plan major dist upgrades. 

➣ Keep up the good work!

➣ Keep up the good work! Started using Debian at version 4 and have never looked back! 

➣ Try to accelerate Debian OS updates.

➣ More game support from the current shooters. More game support from the current shooters.
I now use steam where I have all my games. Unfortunately I cannot play all games on Debian. I am taking it up and hope it will get better in the future.

➣ 1. It would be great if the Debian LTS team could join forces with other distributions providing long-term support - or even vendors providing their own solution on top of Debian LTS - to share workload and/or costs.
2. Ideally Python 2.7 would still receive security updates if required :)

➣ That it continue in some way shape or form.

➣ Make it easy to use alternatives to systemd.

➣ Continue.

➣ I hope it continues as it has.

➣ That the Devs keep it going ...

➣ Keep it going, please!

➣ In certain scenarios and totally market dependent of course, sanction a handful of packages that improve hardware support as optional minor upgrades that do not affect the underlying OS.. e.g., firmware/driver support for core components like graphics, PM and NIC.

➣ Certain packages in the Debian LTS repos can sometimes be a buggy version. While I like the goal of packages not changing, I think updating packages to more stable/less buggy versions should take priority, if said package has some pretty glaring bugs that were fixed in a newer version. I would only recommend this on a case by case basis, though. 
In other words, I feel that Debian LTS's goal should be to assemble the most reliable and stable versions of software, and then lock in that known good version. This is in contrast of keeping buggy versions for the sake of 'stability' in the sense that things don't change.

➣ would be nice to encourage more interaction. im definitely against this whole smartphone craze cuz ya no, it makeds peeps dum n dumerer

➣ Keep up the great job.

➣ None.

➣ Hoping the extended Ubuntu support that was recently announced eases some of the burden to maintain LTS or even ELTS. 

➣ I make small donations to Debian every few years through Software in the Public Interest Inc.  Do you get a share of that?  If not, I note that your donate link here: https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Funding  is for corporate sponsors and the donations are consequently corporate-sized, ie larger.  Maybe consider a simpler one-off donate link for non-corporate users to contribute?

➣ Help on fixing infrastructure bugs (but very importantly in cooperation with the responsables for those systems). There are for instance those issues:
https://bugs.debian.org/796095
https://bugs.debian.org/817285 
https://bugs.debian.org/817286 
https://bugs.debian.org/823820 
Consider doing point releases for LTS itself and hand in hand with that, batch more issues together or, do not rush uploads DLAs for a single non-DLA worthy update (again this causes users to need to update even if the issue is minor)
Consider as part of LTS work perform as well updates for instance in point releases for the non-LTS release.

➣ detailed version control of packages (e.g. several versions of packages like php or mariaDB to choose from)

➣ Good 

➣ show must go on :-)

➣ 1 problem, and that would be for security updates to be available faster :)

➣ All updates should be peer reviewed, rather do fewer updates with higher quality focused on impactful vulnerabilities.

➣ Quite frankly, I think Debian should abandon LTS and concentrate on future and current releases, let Ubuntu (a company that pays it devs) take care of LTS

➣ Keep up the good work!

➣ Have a better overview (dashboard) with the status of different packages.

➣ It would be better if it was part of the Debian project officially 

➣ No

➣ More visibility about LTS and its difference to oldstable. 

➣ Keep going. Maintaining lts is hard but it's necessary. Do not get dragged into the lie of everything needs to be new. Software that works is the foundation of so many things. And we need to trust our OS to be there for us. 

➣ Thankt you very much! :-)

➣ For my own projects testing/unstable (or at worst recent stable) are appropriate, though I am glad that LTS exists for those that need it.
Answering to Q14 below, to a random friend or colleague I would recommend testing rather than stable (nevermind oldstable), particularly for desktop installations.  The people I am in contact with tend to be developers who benefit from access to latest versions. But if I were speaking to a colleague who specifically needed long term stability in their server and software versions, then it would make sense to recommend LTS rather than testing.

➣ It would be nice to have 10 years of support similar to RHEL/CentOS.

➣ Keep the good work.

➣ None.

➣ Keep up the great work!

➣ Thank you! Keep doing what you are doing.

➣ More support for recent drivers/ hardware

➣ Information on point releases and how to best contribute security fixes etc. At the moment, I'm only supporting Debian LTS after being prompted by release managers.

➣ 1. provide more easy to use Debian Installer
2. merge some fixed bugs from LightDM
3. install some required utils and hardware driver by default

➣ Longer support

➣ Same stability but more recent versions.

➣ i guess i could live with a rolling release.

➣ Even longer support, something like CentOS

➣ None

➣ Keep on keepin' on!

➣ Keep going with the great work.

➣ More sharing with debian stable. I have the impression that some updates are only available in LTS

➣ In addition to being able to skip releases when upgrading, I suggest figuring out a way to identify more recent software versions installed not via Debian packaging systems (such as SNAP) and converting them into the corresponding Debian packages when the upgrade happens at last.

➣ Please keep up the good work

➣ Please keep rocking ;)

➣ Keep offer it. Extend it. 

➣ None

➣ Good work and thanks!

➣ none

➣ to be more promoted in and out of Debian

➣ I wish it continues to give me all the more reason to recommend Debian to others 

➣ Please continue the great work

➣ See the LTS suites on the package tracker

➣ Backporting could be a bit more seamless

➣ Keep the good work!

➣ Stronger promote users  to update to stable.

➣ A name change to something that more accurately represents what the project is would be the most positive thing I could suggest.

➣ THANK YOU DEBIAN DEVELOPERS!!! THANK YOU DEBIAN PEOPLE!!! THANK YOU DEBIAN!!!

➣ I would like it if the installer images had more server/enterprise focused package on it by default, like vlan and ipmitool

➣ I only heard of it in debconf19, and, because I appreciate the business model (which is somewhat far from corporate business), I'd be happy to see more friendly parties joining the funding of Debian LTS. What I mean is, I would like to see it look more attractive, with a more modern webpage (instead of the wiki, which is fine for Debian community but not so attractive to non-developers (just a guess, I wouldn't know how to prove my point)). The videos are fine. :)

➣ introduce  HWE kernel like Ubuntu.

➣ Thanks for providing the service. Even if I don't use it right now I may get my company to use it in future (instead of Ubuntu).
I read question 14 as recommend if they can't upgrade easily (instead of prefer to upgrading).

➣ You are doing a great job.

➣ I think I know how much of a drag LTS is, but if I could have a wish, it would be more backports to LTS versions, and generally the ability to install several versions of things in parallel - eg. starting with two different versions of glibc and OpenSSL.

➣ I have none.

➣ Actually I am not using Debian LTS, as I just upgraded all my systems after some hardware fixes, but I was using Debian LTS before these hardware problems.
I wish that Debian LTS has a long live, as I am pretty sure that I will have Debian 10 running in my computers for long time as I did with Debian 8, upgraded to Debian 10 a couple of months ago. 

➣ Try to track kernel updates a tad more often....

➣ Please incorporate some of the backports, maybe dropping the older version if it's too hard to maintain both.

➣ Thank you very much for your efforts, it is very much appreciated.

➣ I don't know how to solve my problem in 12, but it's a lot of pain for an open source maintainer.

➣ I mostly do not think about updates. That is what I prefer. So please keep that up.

➣ Debian LTS should pay and manage their own infrastructure.

➣ I think it's important to ensure that security updates still go out to LTS users. Thank you! 

➣ Keep going!

➣ N/A

➣ Please test packages thoroughly and post DLA notices in good time.

➣ Better website and publicity
Maybe a website or guidance for users of small businesses to help them set up

➣ Keep on good work

➣ Integrate into the stable release/security team.

➣ Thank you for existing! I read that Debian LTS was created originally for corporations. I hope the project can modify that perception so more individuals, families, and non-profits learn about Debian LTS. It is an amazing system for people who want something stable and secure but lack sysadmin resources.

➣ Longer lifetime -- with tiers.  No one uses old releases on desktop, most customers's servers are truly ancient.  Dropping GUI stuff fast would release a good part of tuits, while still providing a much wider coverage than ELTS.  ELTS would then continue from where such reduced-scope LTS ends.

➣ Unclear how to provide LTS packages on q volunteer (non-paid) basis.

➣ Keep itup and thanks so much!

➣ More promotion.
Live kernel patching.

➣ just to be there.

➣ Make it as easy as possible to contribute to the work of security updates.

➣ Please keep doing the awesome work!

➣ Remove systemd

➣ Please keep up your good work.

➣ Plz don't stop it. Laking lts is the reason we (and many others we know) used Ubuntu but we love Debian and wouldn't switch if not realy necessary

➣ Just keep up with the very good work. It makes my life as a sysadmin easier.

➣ I haven't been using Debian LTS for long enough.

➣ Thank you for all the hard work that you do!

➣ Keep being awesome

➣ I would be very appreciated if you can extend support over 6 to 7 years for LTS, then ELTS should extend to 8 to 9 years.

➣ I do not use LTS but I think it's very useful, please go on :-)

➣ I'm amazed and grateful that LTS has managed to consistently secure enough resources to maintain its quality over the years.   My suggestion would be to be vary careful of any more ambitious  proposals  that might increase the workload and risk overextending  the resources available.

➣ Have some automated means to check the current support status (regular support, LTS, ELTS) of a given system for monitoring systems, ideally one that works even on old systems that haven't been updated (sometimes encounter them when taking over systems from third parties as part of transferring a project to us).

➣ Would like to know usecass to show its importance.

➣ Keep a good balance between the packages supported and the size and resources of your team.
Although: the more, the better.

➣ Do not move repositories to archive.debian.org

➣ not exclusive LTS related:
improvements in announcements of releases.
often the releases seems to be only announced via Debian Mailing-list and happened on Weekends.
which sometimes causes trouble or at least additional work on Monday if one detect that anomalies are related to a debian release from the weekend.
these announcements should be sent earlier and better spread on other communication channels then only a Mailing-list.

➣ promote it more

➣ Thanks and please, keep on rocking!

➣ I do not use LTS, but I think LTS is very important in order to defend Debian against other OS in my organisation
Manager or hostile peoples always use the argument of the support in order to dismiss Debian.
For info, I do not use LTs, because I can afford to always use the latest stable Debian on my computers.

➣ keep security patches in whole LTS cycle for all packages if at all possible

➣ It has been a great project which I believe has allowed Debian to do frequent releases whilst still offering long duration for a stable platform.

➣ Backport key software only

➣ Longer then 5 years would help many corporations who just need security updates and are not able to upgrade immediately.  Making ELTS default would be great

➣ Even longer support times would be great (wishful thinking).

➣ maybe I missed it, but it would be nice to have a way to check quicky how far behind LTS is in terms of security upgrades (wrt. stable). That would be helpful when I suggest using LTS instead of going RedHat/Centos/Ubuntu by default because it's supported.

➣ Stay alive! :)

➣ Options for more current versions of applications.

➣ I'm happy you all are supporting an LTS release! So far it's been really straightforward to use. Again, thanks!

➣ Some upstream projects seem to churn frequently, eg. salt. There needs to be a way to have an intentional variable uptake rate mechanism to compensate.  

➣ Please keep it!

➣ keep going

➣ Just keep up the great work and please know it's greatly appreciated and provides huge value :-)

➣ LTS is for users, not for developers. But Linux was created for users first and foremost. This is easy to forget these days.
Consider paid model for ELTS - e.g. via staggered updates availability => patches to be available initially only to paying subscribers for a modest fee and release widely only after a set delay (say 30 days).
This would ensure the primary benefactors from LTS - i.e. organizations - contribute to it financially while casual non-server-use hobbyists will not be affected as they generally do not need latest security patches on day1.

➣ Expand to other fields while keeping the overall theme of user rights as your main motivation

➣ More Transparency

➣ Of course part of me wants LTS to run even longer, but I want that to be balanced out by other needs for Debian and the complexity to provide security updates for old packages.

➣ Simple and safe upgrade to next LTS.

➣ Keep it going! :)

➣ It would be good if there were a notification channel for LTS updates, so I could follow what's coming.

➣ Overall introduction of never software versions should go faster. Indeed this is the trade off of long-term support, but Debian should find a way to integrate upstream updates much faster.

➣ Keep as it is. I want to thank everybody who make LTS/ELTS happen. Working as sysadmin of a small company with limited resources LTS/ELTS provides increased flexibility that helps in long-term server infrastructure planning.

➣ keep up the good work

➣ Keep up the good work, I guess ? Perhaps try to increase the projects visibility, to improve make the funding model work even better.

➣ backports for key packages like letsencrypt would be very, very useful

➣ More tranparency about the fixed bugs and those which can't be fixed and which packages are not supposrted anymore.
