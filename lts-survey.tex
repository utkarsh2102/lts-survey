\section{Introduction}

On July 18th, Stretch LTS started, offering two more years of security support to the Debian Stretch release. Stretch LTS is the fourth iteration of LTS, following Squeeze LTS which started in 2014, Wheezy LTS in 2016, and Jessie LTS in 2018. \par

However, for the first time, we prepared a small survey about our users and contributors, who they are and why they are using LTS. This document compiles the results of that very survey.
