\section{Introduction}

On July 18th, Stretch LTS started, offering two more years of security support to the Debian Stretch
release. Stretch LTS is the fourth iteration of LTS, following Squeeze LTS which started in 2014,
Wheezy LTS in 2016, and Jessie LTS in 2018. \par

\vspace{3mm}
However, for the first time, we prepared a small survey about our users and contributors, who they
are and why they are using LTS. This document compiles the results of that very survey.

\section{Quick Statistics}

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of questions: 14
    \item Survey duration: 2 weeks
    \item Survey start date: July 13th, 2020
    \item Survey end date: July 27th, 2020
    \item Total responses: 1764
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Complete responses: 892
        \item Incomplete responses: 872
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{NOTE}: ``Incomplete responses'' are the surveys that the user started fulfilling and then went
to another place saving for later or even not saving, i.e., data stored but without the user clicking
the ``submit'' button. ``Complete responses'' are the surveys that the user sent by clicking
the ``submit'' button (they can include some unanswered questions, if they were optional).

We've got an overwhelming response from the survey. Below are the compiled responses and the stats.

\subsection{Objective Questions}

\vspace{3mm}
11 out of 14 questions were objective in nature. They are statistically represented with the help
of a bar graph or a pie chart and are as follows.

The remaining 3 questions were subjective in nature. Since it is not possible to represent them
statistically, they link to the private GitHub Gist for complete textual responses.
